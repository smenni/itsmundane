To make sure my priorities align with my everyday actions, I've started to use AI-powered tools to help me stay focused. For example:

* Using Anthropic for summarizing PDFs
* Using Ollama for sensitive information
* Using Groq for fast results

I've also been experimenting with using a teaser as a waitlist on IG/TikTok to get feedback from my audience and identify key segments.
