Hi there, I'm Sarah.

I'm a researcher, designer, tinkerer working for my own company [DREI](https://www.drei-solutions.com) in [Zug, Switzerland](https://maps.app.goo.gl/au1oeXaBksHCnTnF6). If you came here to learn about my professional work, my [website](https://sarahmennicken.com/) will be of more use to you.

Here, I will start sharing my explorations with emerging tech, the newest tools and gadgets and how I'm trying to figure out how the extraordinary might fit into the mundane.
