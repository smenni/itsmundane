I'm afraid of heights. Ok, this seems to have truly nothing to do with tech or everyday problems. But it's become a problem for me, so I'm stretching my definition of "everyday" to this mostly seasonal problem and I'll also make a point of how tech can get involved with it. 

## The Birth of a Fear and a Mountain-Sized Dilemma
I can't remember being particularly afraid of heights as a kid. But after my daughter was born, something changed. Suddenly, any exposure to heights – even just being close to a cliff or steep drop – would trigger a proper physical reaction.

Thanks to not living or working in a sky scraper, it's definitely not a real problem in my everyday life. And as a family member pointed out, I could just, you know, avoid the exposure. But here's the thing: I LOVE the mountains and fell in love with off-piste skiing and ski touring. When my fear of heights started kicking in, even gentle slope 100 meters away from the edge of a cliff gave me anxiety. It affected my skiing technique, my posture too back-seated, and no longer in control. That's a problem especially off-piste: so to be safe, I needed to better deal with that fear.

# Baby Steps and Great Advice 
Having started to ski as an adult only, I figured maybe I just need a better technique and signed up for a ski technique camp. To bring that to different snow conditions, I did a powder skiing class and a freeride camp.

The "Powder" of that Powder skiing class

And sure enough, the fear came along for the camp. However my instructor managed to give me a different perspective on it. When he and a few others dropped over a small cliff, it made me curious enough to ski nearby (but ultimately ski around the drop.) Afterwards he asked me: "did you think about dropping in, too?" and in fact, I did for a split second and that's when what he shared totally reframed my thinking: 

Stage 1: Be absolutely terrified and avoid that situation at all costs.
Stage 2: Daring to get close, but still thinking "Hell no!"
Stage 3: Considering the possibility
Stage 4: Actually doing it!

He pointed out that even by entertaining the idea of the drop, I was already further ahead than I might have thought. This simple reframe gave me such a confdence boost. I realized I'd been stuck at stage 1 for so long, actively avoiding any exposure to heights. But the steps I was taking would take me into the right direction if I don't give up.  

# Can Tech Simulate Real Exposure? 
Inspired by that and since it can be hard to regularly get out into the mountains, I started wondering – could technology help accelerate that journey?  I remembered a VR demo I'd tried years ago at Georgia Tech, where you walked on a real plank put on the floor with a VR headset. Georgia's Tech's research in this space is even going back to 1995 [1][id1]. In the virtual environment, you'd walk down the plank over the side of a skyscrape. The immersion I remember was incredible, triggering that stomach-dropping sensation of being up high. 

So I thought, let's try this again, so I watched POV videos of crazy mountainbikers, skiers and even wingsuit flying, tried a VR game ["The Climb"](https://www.theclimbgame.com/), a smartphone-based VR app called ["EASYHEiGHTs"](https://mcn.unibas.ch/de/publications/mobile-apps/easyheights/) designed specifically to conquer the fear of heights. This app from University of Basel was also studied for its effectiveness and they found good effects after repeated (6 x 30 minutes) app use. I would lie if I said I used it that frequently, so maybe that's why I didn't notice strong effects or physical reaction like when being on an actual mountain. 

But when I recently tried my very first baby via ferrata [Brunnistöckli](https://youtu.be/__Ux2TUIQoE) in Engelberg, it didn't feel quite as intense as I was afraid it would. So maybe that tech exposure had been helping after all?

Mountains and the outdoors might not be everyone's cup of tea. And there are also plenty of ways of enjoying it without having to expose one to a potential fear of heights. But I do think that there's value to expose oneself to one's fears, whatever that might be. Especially for people like me who spend the majority of their lives in  environments designed for humans' comfort. While I have absolutely nothing in common with Alex Honnold, what he said in this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIwoU7-Czp4&ab_channel=HighPerformance) absolutely resonates with me:  *“I think that, if you don’t experience real fear from time to time, you don't experience real danger, then your mind just sort of creates fear out of nothing.”* And tech will only get you so far in providing that "real fear."
