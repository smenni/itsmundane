title: Consume less, create more. Part 1.

Bear with me for a second (what a sentence to start my very first public post...) I need this disclaimer since I've always had mixed feelings about people that write about productivity tools and instruct others to set up these sophisticated, intricate systems. It feels like peak 'productive procrastination.' 

But I promise that while this is *also* doing that a bit, the core message is about how I'm trying to take advantage of the superpowers that new AI tools (really what I mean here is large language models) for my "media consumption." While I've been quite good about accepting that there's not enough time in the world to read the gazillion papers, articles, threads I've bookmarked, I find it harder to ignore the many highlights, notes, and insights I made, but that live scattered across several tools and services. 

## The Starting Point.
**More time to create.** Quite some time ago when we were co-workers at Spotify, the amazing designer [Mat Budelmann](https://substack.com/@practicingdesign) mentioned how he's trying to consume less and create more (now you know, I stole that line!) And that's the ultimate goal, to spend less time managing that firehose of content to consume, and spending more time on creating something original based on my very own reflections and insights. 

**Less 'useless' reading.** There's never enough time to read, and to be honest, with more and more content being generated, it's even becoming hard to figure out what content is worth reading.

**Less screen time.** No this isn't suddenly turning into a parenting post, but just like kids, I shouldn't spent too much time in front of a screen. But my setup required more screen time than I wanted. I love going on long walks or runs and listening to podcasts or even research papers (now that synthetic voices are so good.)

## Obsidian Obsession.
Very timely, my friend [Daniel Leon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielandresleon) introduced me to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and particularly the [Caret Plugin](https://caretplugin.ai/) Plugin which allows you to visually create workflows using any sort of text file and feeding it into an LLM. 

E.g., in the screenshot I'm using a text about California add two nodes in which I ask an LLM to 'Generate keywords to advertise California to techies.' and also "Create a sarcastic tourism slogan." then I can take the results and "Use that info to come up with a tweak and hashtags that are very ironic, but sound serious."

The entire flow:

And to spare you trying to zoom in, this is the result:

On a more serious note though, this tinkering around with it made me wonder, could I pipe in my documents and notes and help me sift through them, helping me resurface my reflections, and give me more mind space to focus on applying those insights to something practical.

...to be continued.
