Pt2..md\n---\ntitle: Consume less, create more. Part 2.\ndraft: false\n---\nIn Part 1, I described my steps towards improving my content consumption. To get more specific, one of my use cases is making sense of the highlights I collect and consolidating my thoughts on them. To ground that in a real example: currently, I'm exploring the mental load of parents and how AI can alleviate it (by now my interests should be quite obvious).\n\n## One Funnel via Readwise\n\nI've explored various online tools for parents, read academic papers, numerous articles and blog posts, listened to several podcasts, and read books. Anything I find interesting in a browser, I save to Readwise. I read books using Kindle on my Boox, and listen to podcasts via Snipd. All of these platforms can sync to Readwise to create a single, streamlined collection point. \n\n>[!question] If anyone knows of an efficient \"Blinkist to Readwise\" workflow, please share your insights.\n\nUsing the official Readwise plugin, everything is synced into Obsidian. Each item from Readwise is transformed into a note that incorporates all the highlights I've made. While this setup may sound complex, it work really well for me as it requires no more manual involvement. Ultimately, everything ends up in Obsidian, where it's indexed and searchable and I no longer need to jump between different tools just to organize my thoughts.\n\n>[!tip] Handy shortcut for less screen time:\n>**AirPod Triple-Press.** You can set this up as a shortcut to make highlights in Reader by Readwise and in Snipd. This offers a direct, screen-free route from listening to having my highlights ready in Obsidian.\n\n## Enzyme Energy\n\nThis is where another  tool from another amazing former co-worker, [Josh Pham](https://www.jpham.space/), comes into play. Josh developed a plugin called [Enzyme](https://www.enzyme.garden/) for Obsidian that enables the use of LLMs directly within your notes. This plugin can be used right within the text of your notes, which I find incredibly convenient for writing. There's no need to toggle between a writing tool and a browser anymore, and depending on my needs, I don't even have to switch between notes or different views in Obsidian.\n\nTo reconnect this to my current focus on the mental load of parenting and the use of AI to assist with it, I asked Enzyme to reflect on my thinking and help me identify common themes. Everybody might have a different way to tag highlights, but I typically only use per-document tags, such as \\#mentalload and \\#parenting.\n\nLet's say I want to figure out the general themes of the related content I've recently read and understand how they might connect. In that case, I can ask Enzyme to \"Identify and explain three common themes between \\#mentalload and \\#parenting,\" and it provides an answer directly in the same note, as shown in this screenshot:\n\n> ![](enzyme-examples.png)\n\nNow I can just pull out anything that seems useful in the output, as it's simply text in my note. I can also highlight parts that resonate with me and ask Enzyme to expand on it (was so close to using 'delve into' here, but didn't want to sound like your average ChatGPT)  as illustrated in this screenshot:\n\n![](enzyme-highlights.png)\n\nWhile it may seem a bit meta to ask an LLM to write about a dystopian versus utopian vision of how technologies \"like itself\" might be used in the context of parenting, I hope this brings back the point of how valuable it can be to have access to a tool that's aware of all my highlights and helps me organize them across various areas of interest.\n\n## Inspiration from You\nI love learning from others and am a big fan of people sharing their workflows, tips, and tricks. If you've put LLMs to creative use that helps you \"think better,\" I'd love to hear about it via [Twitter](https://x.com/SarahMennicken)\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions for Connecting to Part 1 and Making the Content More Engaging:**\n\n1. **Bridge the Topics Clearly**: Begin Part 2 with a clearer connection back to Part 1. For instance, \"In Part 1, we explored initial steps towards optimizing our consumption of content. Now, let's delve deeper into practical tools and real-life applications that can enhance our creative processes.\"\n\n2. **Storytelling Element**: Add personal anecdotes or stories that illustrate the frustrations of dealing with scattered highlights and the relief or benefits provided by using tools like Readwise and Enzyme. This personal touch can make the content more relatable and engaging.\n\n3. **Interactive Elements**: Consider incorporating interactive elements such as polls or quizzes about readers’ experiences with productivity tools or their ideas on using AI to handle mental load. This would increase engagement and offer you valuable feedback.\n\n4. **Visual Content**: Include more screenshots or even video tutorials showing how you use these tools. Visual aids can help readers better understand the setups and get inspired to try them out.\n\n5. **Call to Action for Community Contribution**: Stress the community aspect more at the end. Encourage readers to share their setups or write guest posts on your blog about their experiences. This not only enriches your content but also builds a community of like-minded individuals.\n\nBy focusing on clear connections, personal stories, interactive and visual content, and fostering community interactions, Part 2 can become a highly engaging and integral continuation of Part 1.","role":"assistant","displayOverride":true,"x":1200,"y":2680,"width":750,"height":4270,"color":"4"},

		{"id":"6e9a8061005fed05","type":"text","text":"# Leveraging AI to Enhance Domestic Life: A Holistic Approach\n\nAs our lives become increasingly hectic and demanding, the need to find ways to streamline and simplify our everyday tasks has never been more pressing. Emerging technologies, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), offer promising solutions to address the \"invisible labor\" that often burdens modern households. I recently came across the exciting news that Ario, an AI-powered assistant for parents, raised $16 million in funding. This milestone highlights the growing recognition of AI's potential to alleviate the mental load associated with household management. But I think there's so much more to explore here, so let's dive in!\n\n## The Power of Prompt Engineering\n\nThe potential of AI in domestic environments extends beyond just parenting responsibilities. A fascinating concept I stumbled upon in a Forbes article is \"prompt engineering.\" This technique helps optimize the speed and efficiency of AI-powered tools, enabling them to seamlessly integrate into our daily lives. By crafting well-designed prompts, users can unlock the full potential of generative AI models, streamlining tasks and freeing up valuable time.\n\nFor instance, imagine having an AI that can quickly generate your weekly grocery list based on your meal plans and dietary preferences. Cool, right? It's a bit like having a super-efficient, always-on personal assistant who knows you better than you know yourself. Being a bit of a tech geek, I've dabbled with creating prompts for various AI tools, and let me tell you—there's a lot of untapped potential here.\n\n## Shifting the Focus: Outputs Over Time\n\nAnother compelling avenue for integrating AI into our homes is drawing inspiration from the consulting industry’s shift to \"selling outputs, not time.\" This approach, illuminated in a Personal Math article, suggests focusing on high-value deliverables that AI can consistently and reliably produce. By identifying specific tasks where AI can excel (like meal planning, scheduling, or even managing routine chores), we empower users to access these technologies' benefits without the burden of complex implementation.\n\nImagine your AI assistant taking care of all those mundane tasks that eat up your time. Instead of spending hours planning your week, you get a tailored schedule pinged to your phone every Sunday night. This shift towards output-based solutions can revolutionize how we approach everyday tasks, ultimately enhancing our overall quality of life.\n\n## A Glimpse into an AI-Enhanced Home\n\nBy combining insights from diverse sources, we can envision a holistic approach to leveraging AI in domestic environments. Picture this: an AI-powered assistant seamlessly handles your scheduling, meal planning, and household chores, while providing personalized recommendations and anticipating your needs. Sounds like a dream, right? Trust me, it's closer than you think.\n\nThis shift towards output-based solutions, enabled by advancements in prompt engineering and AI capabilities, can save us precious time and mental energy. From my own experience, even small integrations—like having an AI suggest my outfit based on the weather and my calendar—make a huge difference in my daily routine.\n\n![AI Assistant Scheduling](https://example.com/image.jpg)\n*Caption: An AI-powered assistant seamlessly integrating into daily life.*\n\n## Societal Benefits and Gender Parity\n\nBeyond individual households, the potential impact of this approach extends to broader societal benefits. AI-powered tools can help reduce the burden of \"invisible labor\" that disproportionately falls on women and caregivers. By offloading mundane tasks through AI, we can create a more equitable distribution of domestic responsibilities, fostering greater gender parity and work-life balance.\n\nI've personally seen how AI-assistants can redistribute household tasks, easing pressure on primary caregivers. Imagine your AI reminding you and your partner about chores, creating a fair division without the need for those endless \"who's turn is it?\" debates (relationship goals, anyone?).\n\n## Challenges and Ethical Considerations\n\nOf course, no technology comes without its challenges. The experimental and R&D nature of AI technologies means that the path to widespread adoption may not be straightforward. Data privacy, transparency, and ethical considerations are crucial as these AI-powered solutions become more prevalent in our homes.\n\nTaking sensible precautions, like using AI systems from reputable developers and understanding what data is being collected and how it's used, is vital. I've made it a practice to always read through terms and conditions (yes, really) before integrating any new AI tool into my home.\n\n## Conclusion: Embracing the Future\n\nThe promise of AI-driven enhancements to our daily lives is undeniable. By leveraging insights from diverse perspectives—prompt engineering to output-based service models—we can create a future where technology seamlessly integrates with our domestic environments. This approach not only enhances our productivity and well-being but also represents a promising frontier in the ongoing quest to optimize and simplify our everyday experiences.\n\nAre you ready to embrace AI in your home? If you've already started, what are your favorite tools or hacks? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences—drop a comment below!\n\n---\n\nBy weaving practical advice with personal anecdotes and well-researched insights, we can harness the true potential of AI to enhance our domestic lives meaningfully.

What do I need to think about?```\n\nAnd it gave me a comprehensive timeline, covering everything from choosing a theme to setting up activity stations on the day of the party. \n\n```\nTimeline and Preparation:\n- 4 weeks before the party:\n\t- Choose the theme, create invitations, and send them out.\n\t- Plan the menu and activities.\n- 2 weeks before the party:\n\t- Purchase or create decorations, party favors, and supplies.\n\t- Confirm RSVPs and finalize the guest list.\n- 1 week before the party:\n\t- Prepare a shopping list for food and any last-minute supplies.\n- 2 days before the party:\n\t- Do the grocery shopping.\n\t- Assemble party favors.\n- 1 day before the party:\n\t- Prepare any make-ahead food items.\n\t- Set up the party area and decorations.\n- Party day:\n\t- Prepare remaining food.\n\t- Set up activity stations.\n```\n\nBack in early 2023, the novelty factor of LLM producing a solid result definitely made me more excited than it does now in 2024. Even then I remember thinking, I could have just googled for it and probably gotten the exact same answer. \n\nBUT I also remember, that I realized, that it meant that I have created a thread with this \"thing\" and it knows (at least for a bit) the entire context. \n## I want to pick an option, not come up with them.\nSo I started playing around with it. With it knowing the context, I could now ask follow up questions.  ```Give me 3 recommendations for the theme.```\n\nThe output was a little disappointing in terms of being very gendered. ```How about Princess Party, Unicorn Magic, or Mermaid under the Sea``` (while for boys it was ```Superhero Adventure, Dinosaur Dig, or Space Explorer```. While there's nothing wrong with any of those themes, I needed some course correction because we had enough unicorn and princesses in the years prior, eventually it came up with ```Enchanted Forest``` which we all liked. \n\nThen there's all these little things that you could go into a rabbit hole on Pinterest or DIY groups (which I'm a big fan of and therefore in danger of.) But when I asked ChatGPT to ```give me ideas for activities, food options, and party favors for the theme of Unicorn Superhero ``` it delivered!\n\n```\n- Activities:\n    - Fairy House Craft: Provide small boxes, paint, and natural materials like twigs, leaves, and flowers for kids to create their own fairy houses.\n    - Forest Animal Scavenger Hunt: Hide pictures or small toys of forest animals around the party area for kids to find.\n    \n- Food options:\n    - Woodland-themed cupcakes or cookies (e.g., mushrooms, animals, or trees)\n    - \"Magic\" fruit wands (fruit skewers with star-shaped fruit at the top)\n    - Forest trail mix (nuts, dried fruit, and chocolate chips)\n\n- Party favors:\n    - Small fairy or gnome figurines\n    - Enchanted forest-themed coloring books\n    - Nature-themed temporary tattoos\n```\n\nThis was a solid start! And even though I didn't pick up everything exactly like this, ==it feels simply much easier to decide between a few options than starting from scratch.== (reference to that paper) \n\n# Check for locations\nI also tried to get some good recommendations for where to host this party nearby and while it had some ideas that would technically fit the specs o, they were actually not useful (well, maybe you celebrate your kids' birthday in an event location with a capacity of up to 1000 people but it wasn't what we were going for her birthday this year ;)) And I couldn't get it to even come up with the go-to destinations that local parents would tell you about.\n\nFast forward to this year, we already had a destination in mind and because last year it didn't really help sending out invites via email to the parents but instead everyone here is using Whatsapp, I wanted to just create a little cute visual illustration to send around with the details. So I decided to put ChatGPT to the test. \n\n# Create invites\nAnd it's super useful, that is, if you know how to lightly edit the output because it never fully got all the details right. I know that it's not designed to do that, but even if you know how it works under the hood, it's kind of hilarious to see some technology creating something visual that is sooooo close to what you want, but sadly not exactly what you need.\n\n![[Pasted image 20240722142344.png]]\n![[Pasted image 20240722142350.png]]\n![[Pasted image 20240722142356.png]]\n![[CELEBRATE.jpg]\n\n## My take-away\nLong story short, I loved using ChatGPT for planning my daughter's birthday parties because\n- **It got me unstuck.**  It helped me move past the initial 'blank canvas' problem and not waste my energy on simply coming up with ideas and a check list.\n- **It leverages best practices.** Because of the nature of LLMs, it will surface existing patterns, like the things that people have been writing about a whole bunch on the internet.

Creating magical moments for my daughter is rewarding but exhausting, even when shared with my husband.\n\n## Just tell me what to do.\n\nFor the past two years, I've used ChatGPT for party planning. \n\n### Year 1: Basic Planning\nI asked, \"I want to plan a 5th birthday party for my daughter. What do I need to think about?\" Here’s the comprehensive timeline it provided:\n- **4 weeks:** Choose theme, send invitations, plan menu and activities.\n- **2 weeks:** Buy decorations, party favors, confirm RSVPs.\n- **1 week:** Make final shopping list.\n- **2 days:** Grocery shopping, assemble party favors.\n- **1 day:** Prepare make-ahead food, set up.\n- **Party day:** Final food prep, setup activity stations.\n\nThe initial excitement about ChatGPT’s help made me realize its contextual awareness could be more useful than a simple Google search.\n\n## Picking Options, Not Generating Them\n\nKnowing the context, I asked for theme suggestions. While the initial ideas were gendered (e.g., Princess Party, Superhero Adventure), we eventually settled on \"Enchanted Forest.\" For activities, food options, and party favors, I followed up with:\n\n```\n- **Activities:**\n  - Fairy House Craft\n  - Forest Animal Scavenger Hunt\n- **Food:** \n  - Woodland-themed cupcakes\n  - \"Magic\" fruit wands\n  - Forest trail mix\n- **Party favors:**\n  - Fairy or gnome figurines\n  - Coloring books\n  - Nature-themed tattoos\n```\n\nIt was easier to decide between a few options rather than starting from scratch.\n\n## Location and Invitations\n\nWhile ChatGPT’s local venue suggestions were oversized, I found it helpful for creating visual invitations to send via WhatsApp—though some light","role":"assistant","displayOverride":true,"x":-600,"y":-632,"width":510,"height":1800,"color":"4"},
