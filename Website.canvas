I need this disclaimer since I've always had mixed feelings about people that write about productivity tools and instruct others to set up these sophisticated, intricate systems. It feels like peak 'productive procrastination.'\"\n\nThis opening sentence is a bit awkwardly phrased. Consider rephrasing it for better flow: \"As I start my public writing journey, I want to acknowledge the mixed feelings I have about people sharing productivity tools and elaborate systems.\"\n\n* \"But I promise that while this is *also* doing that a bit, the core message is about how I'm trying to take advantage of the 'AI superpowers' (really what I mean here is large language models) for my media consumption.\"\n\nThis sentence could be rephrased for better clarity: \"While this post will touch on productivity tools, the main goal is to explore how AI can help me consume and process information more efficiently.\"\n\n* \"## The Starting Point.\"\n\t+ These section headings are quite long. Consider shortening them to something like \"**Starting Point**\" or simply \"#\"\n\t+ The first sentence of this section seems a bit out of place. You might consider moving it closer to the preceding paragraph.\n* \"Less screen time.\" No, this isn't suddenly turning into a parenting post, but just like kids, I should spent less time in front of a screen.\"\n\nThe parenthetical aside here feels unnecessary and disrupts the flow. Consider removing it: \"I should spend less time in front of a screen, just like kids do.\"\n\n* \"E.g., in the screenshot I'm using a card with some text about California, then added two more cards, one in which I ask an LLM to 'generate keywords to advertise California to techies.' and in the other to 'create a sarcastic tourism slogan.'\"\n\nThis sentence is quite long. Consider breaking it up into shorter sentences for better clarity: \"I created a card with text about California, then added two more cards. One asked an LLM to generate keywords for advertising California to techies, while the other requested a sarcastic tourism slogan.\"\n\n* The inline images (![[flow-overview.png]] and ![[flow-tweet.png]]) might be distracting or difficult to view for some readers. Consider rephrasing the surrounding text to provide more context about what these images show.\n\nThese are just minor suggestions; overall, your writing is clear and engaging!","role":"assistant","displayOverride":true,"x":1156,"y":-1202,"width":510,"height":2655,"color":"4"}
