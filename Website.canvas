Pt2..md\n---\ntitle: Consume less, create more. Part 2.\ndraft: false\n---\nIn Part 1, I described my steps towards improving my content consumption. To get more specific, one of my use cases is making sense of the highlights I collect and consolidating my thoughts on them. To ground that in a real example: currently, I'm exploring the mental load of parents and how AI can alleviate it (by now my interests should be quite obvious).\n\n## One Funnel via Readwise\n\nI've explored various online tools for parents, read academic papers, numerous articles and blog posts, listened to several podcasts, and read books. Anything I find interesting in a browser, I save to Readwise. I read books using Kindle on my Boox, and listen to podcasts via Snipd. All of these platforms can sync to Readwise to create a single, streamlined collection point. \n\n>[!question] If anyone knows of an efficient \"Blinkist to Readwise\" workflow, please share your insights.\n\nUsing the official Readwise plugin, everything is synced into Obsidian. Each item from Readwise is transformed into a note that incorporates all the highlights I've made. While this setup may sound complex, it work really well for me as it requires no more manual involvement. Ultimately, everything ends up in Obsidian, where it's indexed and searchable and I no longer need to jump between different tools just to organize my thoughts.\n\n>[!tip] Handy shortcut for less screen time:\n>**AirPod Triple-Press.** You can set this up as a shortcut to make highlights in Reader by Readwise and in Snipd. This offers a direct, screen-free route from listening to having my highlights ready in Obsidian.\n\n## Enzyme Energy\n\nThis is where another  tool from another amazing former co-worker, [Josh Pham](https://www.jpham.space/), comes into play. Josh developed a plugin called [Enzyme](https://www.enzyme.garden/) for Obsidian that enables the use of LLMs directly within your notes. This plugin can be used right within the text of your notes, which I find incredibly convenient for writing. There's no need to toggle between a writing tool and a browser anymore, and depending on my needs, I don't even have to switch between notes or different views in Obsidian.\n\nTo reconnect this to my current focus on the mental load of parenting and the use of AI to assist with it, I asked Enzyme to reflect on my thinking and help me identify common themes. Everybody might have a different way to tag highlights, but I typically only use per-document tags, such as \\#mentalload and \\#parenting.\n\nLet's say I want to figure out the general themes of the related content I've recently read and understand how they might connect. In that case, I can ask Enzyme to \"Identify and explain three common themes between \\#mentalload and \\#parenting,\" and it provides an answer directly in the same note, as shown in this screenshot:\n\n> ![](enzyme-examples.png)\n\nNow I can just pull out anything that seems useful in the output, as it's simply text in my note. I can also highlight parts that resonate with me and ask Enzyme to expand on it (was so close to using 'delve into' here, but didn't want to sound like your average ChatGPT)  as illustrated in this screenshot:\n\n![](enzyme-highlights.png)\n\nWhile it may seem a bit meta to ask an LLM to write about a dystopian versus utopian vision of how technologies \"like itself\" might be used in the context of parenting, I hope this brings back the point of how valuable it can be to have access to a tool that's aware of all my highlights and helps me organize them across various areas of interest.\n\n## Inspiration from You\nI love learning from others and am a big fan of people sharing their workflows, tips, and tricks. If you've put LLMs to creative use that helps you \"think better,\" I'd love to hear about it via [Twitter](https://x.com/SarahMennicken)\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions for Connecting to Part 1 and Making the Content More Engaging:**\n\n1. **Bridge the Topics Clearly**: Begin Part 2 with a clearer connection back to Part 1. For instance, \"In Part 1, we explored initial steps towards optimizing our consumption of content. Now, let's delve deeper into practical tools and real-life applications that can enhance our creative processes.\"\n\n2. **Storytelling Element**: Add personal anecdotes or stories that illustrate the frustrations of dealing with scattered highlights and the relief or benefits provided by using tools like Readwise and Enzyme. This personal touch can make the content more relatable and engaging.\n\n3. **Interactive Elements**: Consider incorporating interactive elements such as polls or quizzes about readers’ experiences with productivity tools or their ideas on using AI to handle mental load. This would increase engagement and offer you valuable feedback.\n\n4. **Visual Content**: Include more screenshots or even video tutorials showing how you use these tools. Visual aids can help readers better understand the setups and get inspired to try them out.\n\n5. **Call to Action for Community Contribution**: Stress the community aspect more at the end. Encourage readers to share their setups or write guest posts on your blog about their experiences. This not only enriches your content but also builds a community of like-minded individuals.\n\nBy focusing on clear connections, personal stories, interactive and visual content, and fostering community interactions, Part 2 can become a highly engaging and integral continuation of Part 1.","role":"assistant","displayOverride":true,"x":1200,"y":2680,"width":750,"height":4270,"color":"4"}
